      Push for AI-native
    </h1>
    <p>
      When AI as we know it today came out, I was an advocate for it. While
      clearly a tech demo, it showed spectacular promise. This feeling of
      adoration didn&apos;t last long
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote a whole piece (and then deleted it) on the environmental and
      social damage that is required for AI to print out an overly shiny picture
      of a cat, but this is a topic that&apos;s been well covered already. It
      sucks, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be getting better
    </p>
    <p>
      What is new (to me at least) are the changes it caused to my day-to-day
      life. the other day, &quot;the business&quot; (AKA my employer) shared
      their goals. As teams and individuals it&apos;s our job to figure out how
      we can contribute towards those goals. That&apos;s why we got hired,
      that&apos;s why they send us money every month
    </p>
    <p>
      The first goal was become &quot;AI-native&quot;. That gave me pause,
      because it would be akin to asking us to contribute towards becoming
      screwdriver-native. AI is a tool, which can be used to solve problems, why
      are we being asked to become native in a tool?
    </p>
    <p>
      To help us out, management drafted a few initiatives. How nice of them to
      interpret it for us, I certainly wasn&apos;t looking forward to a
      &quot;figure out what AI-native means&quot; ticket, but it seems like I
      lucked out. The thinking has been done already yey! Alright, gimme the
      first initiative, lets do it
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Every engineer is to use at least 3 AI tools</em>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Qu√©? Before the end of the meeting, that initiative was already marked as
      done, because apparently we all already do it. My confusion is increasing,
      because the only AI i actively use is a hard AI in Starcraft, and
      that&apos;s certainly not what they meant. But hey, what a department! We
      are closing initiatives before they are even open, does it make our
      velocity infinite?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>100% of code has been attempted to be written by AI</em>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me get this straight. At an engineering org, where developers struggle
      to write a unit test, we are to use experimental technology, known for
      making things up, to write all the code for us. We can&apos;t even prove
      what our own code does, and we are to hand it off to a bs-machine? What
      problem are we trying to solve here? A cynic might say that management
      believes that AI would produce better results than us, but if I go down
      that road it leads to some pretty existential questions, and I might start
      wondering if this initiative is actually a thinly veiled insult
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Write 5 blog posts on our adoption of AI</em>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, here we go. We are not becoming AI-native because it&apos;ll make us
      better/quicker/faster. It&apos;s done purely for improving our perception
      for current and future investors. It&apos;s an amazing label, with zero
      thought on how it might actually be perceived by your own employees. Who
      cares about churn, when you can raise round ZY, and keep off the death of
      the business for another year. B-corp? Ethics? You&apos;ll struggle to
      find them in this world, even among those who claim to be better
    </p>
    <p>
      But don&apos;t worry folks! AI will save us, it&apos;ll lead us to clean
      water and force us to drink it. The one true saviour of all corporations
      out there
    </p>
    <p>
      So what about those who have some self-respect left and still have some
      strength left in them? I strongly believe that there are normal people out
      there, who are willing to pay you good money for you to actually produce
      good work, that&apos;s used. People who will respect you and your time.
      They must be there, because the world keeps spinning. _Someone_ is keeping
      all the systems working, and I can guarantee you its not those who think
      forcing a tool on professionals is the way forward
